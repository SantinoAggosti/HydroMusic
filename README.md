Project: Hydro_Music 

Project Description:

# Step 1: Installation

Read this file from start to finish and download the "Hydro_Music.ino" file. This file contains the whole code for the circuit.

# Step 2: Assemble the circuit

Assemble the circuit following the diagram layout.png attached to the sketch

# Step 3: Load the code

Upload the code contained in the sketch on to your board.

# BOM
The materials you need for this project.

Arduino Uno
Water Sensor 
Button   
Buzzer         
Wires         


# Considerations
In the layout.png file, the IR sensor is what represents the water sensor that should be used for this project. Thinkercad has not implemented such circuit component yet. 
Make sure to read the whole documentation of the water sensor you are going to be using, and be always aware of the fact that if repeating this project, should be accompanied by an adult if not one already.
